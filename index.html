            <p>TLDR: <a href="http://ethereum.org" target="blank">Etherum</a> is a <i>computing platform</i> running on computers all over the world. To run programs on the network you pay <a href="https://ethereum.org/ether" target="blank">Ether</a> (<a href="https://poloniex.com/exchange#usdt_eth">ETH</a>); you can program on the Ethereum network using a language named <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/" target="blank">Solidity</a>.</p>

                        Ethereum is a way for a bunch of computers to talk to each other. People can ask these computers to run programs that can't easily be shut down because all the computers share the code with each other.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you want to run a program that takes a long time to finish, you have to pay the computers in the network a currency called Ether.

                    <h2>An unregulated, global financial market with a multimillion USD market cap, yes please!</h2>

                    <p>Why would you want to create a scam using Ethereum? Well, because it's a financial wild west: unregulated, unsafe, and large enough you can hide in plain sight.</p>

                    <h2>Ponzi Schemes</h2>
                    <p>So, first-off let's talk about ponzi schemes. Ethereum executes smart contracts that allow you to strictly enforce the execution of a ponzi scheme with no oversight after people start buying in. The code will continue executing indefinitely.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Some researchers from Cornell University did <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03779.pdf" target="blank">extensive research</a> to discover, classify, and analyze ponzi schemes running on the the Ethereum platform. I'll summarize their findings like this: those participating in the ponzi schemes were <a href="https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/4632/introducing-dynamic-pyramid-3x-1-2x-payouts-verified-contract" target="blank">doing so</a> <a href="https://ponzico.win" target="blank">knowningly</a>.</p>

                    <p>From the PDF:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Still, it is foreseeable that, as Ethereum consolidates its position as a platform for smart contracts and as a cryptocurrency, criminals will exploit it to host their scams. Besides the growth of traditional Ponzi schemes accepting ether, we expect a second wave of Ponzi schemes, but very likely they will be less recognizable as such than the ones collected in this survey. For instance, they could mix multi-level marketing, token sales, and games, to realize complex smart contracts, which would be very hard to correctly classify as Ponzi schemes or legit investments.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Our analysis suggests that there is still time to devise suitable policy interventions, and provides a first understanding of the issues that must be tackled in this direction.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>ICOs</h2>
                    <p>
                        An ICO stands for an "Initial Coin Offering", which is a way for anyone to raise money using the Ethereum platform. One would simply make a website stating what problem the company is trying to solve, they list their ICO on one of <a href="https://www.ico-list.com/" target="blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.coinschedule.com/" target="blank">websites</a>.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As of June 2017, I'm going to keep ICOs on the "explain it like I'm a scammer page" because I don't believe there is enough accountability in the community surrounding 2 things:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Truthfully stating what the company intends to accomplish.</li>
                        <li>Being held accountable for producing results.</li>
                        <li>Not overhyping their ICO using tactics like "IPCO windows" where the ICO launches at a specific date and ends at a fixed time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Essentially, many regulations that exist in existing financial markets exist for a reason. Not having some of these regulations leads to unsafe investments.

                    <h2>Ethereum is kinda nerdy</h2>
                    <p>But that's ok, so is the internet. It's not hard to understand though, so don't be scared by all of the jargon! Here are a few keywords to get started.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Decentralized</b> - computers located  all over the world, working together, if half of the computers are turned off, the other half will continue operating as if nothing happened.
                        <li><b>Cryptocurrency</b> - a kind of digital money that gets it's value from having computers do hard math problems.</li>
                        <li><b>Computing Platform</b> - this is a fancy way of saying a network of computers that run programs together.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Ok! So now we're going to put all those terms together to try and explain what Ethereum is.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that executes programs, in order to pay for the computing power used to execute these programs you pay with a cryptocurrency called Ether.
                    </p>

                    <h2>So what, why do people care about Ethereum so much?</h2>
                    <p>
                    If you've heard about Etherem it's probably for one of two reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Speculative investing</b> - because you can buy Ether at places called <a href="http://coinbase.com" target="blank">exchanges</a> and more and more people are buying Ether, less of it is available and so the price is rising. However, like buying stocks in the stock market where companies can have ups and downs, Ethereum could experience this too, and the Ether people buy could lose value very rapidly.</li>
                        <li><b>Technological excitement</b> - many people are excited about Ethereum because, much in the same was that the internet changed how everyone communicates, Ethereum has the potential to change how much of the world exchanges money, and organizes around trust.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Ok, so should I do anything about it?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Probably not right now, unless you're pretty nerdy or you <a href="index.html#investor">understand how investing works<a/> (and have money to lose). Ethereum is too new a technology to worry about.

                    <h2>Raising Money on Ethereum Blockchain</h2>

                    <p>
                        So, elsewhere on this website I mention that ICOs are potentially scammy vehicles for unscrupulous fundraising. Conversely, token offerings can be used by companies that are indeed legitimate in order to raise money for their projects. Ethereum initially raised money to start the project itself using Bitcoin, and has gone on to build off the smart contract system intrinsic in it's own platform to <a target="blank" href="https://www.ethereum.org/token">allow anyone to create a token</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Wait, What are Tokens Exactly?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tokens are a digital asset (specific to a particular project/company) that can be used like a currency, build on top of the Ethereum blockchain. In order to acquire a particular token you would exchange ETH for that token. Different tokens may have different contracts though, so not all tokens are created equally, but generally in an ICO tokens are being used like stocks, allowing you to own a portion of a company in exchange for ETH. The value of the token changes based on demand for that particular token, and you can convert your holdings of a certain token back to ETH by selling it on <a target="blank" href="https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_eth">an exchange that lists ETH tokens</a> (or in person).
                        If you want to know more I highly recommend <a target="blank" href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-tokens-fbd5611fe30b">this blog post</a> written by <a href="https://medium.com/@linda.xie">Linda Xie.</a>

                        <p>
                            Imagine the Ethereum Network like a giant, global dispensary and farmer's co-op that nobody owns. Instead, members of the network pitch in the occasional bud (computer resources) when someone about to have a much bigger party (C++ developers, wizards, etc.) needs to borrow from the stash. These "parties" could be all kinds of things from distributed movie renderings to web applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unlike bumming your friend smokes, however, or central banks, user of your "bud" is backed by "smart contracts" which ensure that participants of the Ethereum Network are compensated even if the party really sucked. This means more parties, bigger parties and better yet, parties which can't leave everyone broke.
